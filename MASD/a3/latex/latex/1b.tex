To find all the extremum points of the function we have to look at where $f'(x) = 0$. To find whether the points are local maxima or minima, we have to look at $f''(x)$.

$$f(x) = x^2ln(x)$$
$$f'(x) = 2xln(x)+x$$
First we try to find if, and where $f'(x)$ intersects the x-axis. For this we used Wolfram Alpha to determine that it is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{e}}$\\
Now we know that $f(x)$ has a local extremum in $f(\frac{1}{\sqrt{e}}$. To find whether it is a local maximum or minimum, we simply compute the following:
$$f''(x) = 2ln(x)+3$$
$$f''(\frac{1}{\sqrt{e}}) = 2$$
Now we know that $f''(x)$ is positive in the local extremum, and can conclude that it is a local minimum.
