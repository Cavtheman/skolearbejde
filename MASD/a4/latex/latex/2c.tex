There would need to be a few changes to the function for it to work with variable lengths:\\
\\
First, we would have to find a way to calculate the length between the different inputs. $(x_i-x_{i-1})$. This would require a different type of input, perhaps an array of tuples, each with the value of the function, and the distance from the previous element.\\\\
Second, we would also have to multiply the value of each element by this length, to find the approximation of the area. Only then would we sum everything together as before.
