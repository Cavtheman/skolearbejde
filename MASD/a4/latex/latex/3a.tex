To find the discrete convolution of $f[x]$ we have to compute the following function:
$$
\sum_{n=0}^mf[n]*g[m-n]
$$
Where, m is the index of $f*g$. We will show the procedure only for the first and last few entries:
$$
(f*g)[0] = f[0]*g[0-0] = 1*1 = 1
$$
$$
(f*g)[1] = f[0]*g[1-0] + f[1]*g[1-1] = 1*1+2*1 = 3
$$
\begin{center}
...
\end{center}
$
(f*g)[11] = f[0]*g[11-0] + f[1]*g[10-1] + ...+ f[10]*g[10-10] = 7*0+2+4*0= 2
$\\
Before $f[0]$ and after $f[10]$ the functions will simply evaluate to $0$. This means that $(f*g)$ is 11 units long, ignoring all edges where $(f*g)=0$, because all indices in the function would be out of bounds in both arrays:
$$(f*g) = [1,3,2,-2,-2,0,-2,-4,-1,3,2]$$
