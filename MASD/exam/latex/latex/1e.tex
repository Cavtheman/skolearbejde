When plotting for different values of $d$ than $4$, the function becomes more and more erratic and inaccurate the further away from $4$ you get. At small differences, such as $d=3$, you get only barely perceptible changes. For $d=2$ however, you only get a straight line. For larger values, you get extremely erratic functions, that are significantly different, if you move just one $x$ higher.
