For this, I assume that the given values for $x$ and $y$ are all the values possible. If that assumption is true, then the final joint pmf will look as follows:\\
\begin{tabular}{l||l|l|l}
$p(x,y)$ & y=-1 & y=1  & y=3  \\ \hline
x=-1   & 0.1  & 0.1  & 0.4  \\ \hline
x = 1  & 0.3  & 0.05 & 0.05
\end{tabular}\\
The reason for this is because the joint pmf must be equal to 1. So we simply calculate:
$$
1 - (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 2(0.05)) = 0.4
$$
