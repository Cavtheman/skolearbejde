MASD is, among other things:
      Netflix problem: generating assumptions from dataset with missing data
      image analysis, multidimensional derivatives
      proofs that what you're doing is true
first couple of weeks is calculus, writing proofs

Writing proofs:
        What does it take to be a proof:
             correct assumptions
             claim
             logical steps from assumption to claim
             needs to be clear for human reader
Convergence:
