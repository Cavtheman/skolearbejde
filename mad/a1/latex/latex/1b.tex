To find the probability that it stops functioning within the given time interval, we calculate the definite integral between $[0,4]$, since we know that:
$$
F(x \leq 0) = 0
$$
We compute the following with Wolfram Alpha:
$$
\int_0^{4}f(x) = \int_0^{4} \frac{\alpha e^{-(\beta x)^\alpha} (\beta x)^\alpha}{x}dx = F(4) - F(0)
$$
$$
(1 - e^{-(\frac{4}{4})^{2}}) - (1 - e^{-(\frac{0}{4})^{2}}) = 0.632
$$
We then subtract this from $1$ because that is the reverse case:
$$
1- 0.632 = 0.368
$$
For the second part we have to compute the definite integral with boundaries $[5,10]$:
$$
\int_5^{10} f(x) = \int_5^{10}\frac{\alpha e^{-(\beta x)^\alpha} (\beta x)^\alpha}{x}dx = F(10) - F(5)
$$
We compute this with Wolfram Alpha:
$$
(1 - e^{-(\frac{10}{4})^{2}}) - (1 - e^{-(\frac{5}{4})^{2}}) = 0.208
$$
This means that there is a 20.8\% chance of the chip breaking in this interval
