This may be slightly difficult to read, but the solid lines are either axes or part of the plane resulting from the function. The dotted lines are for ease of viewing, to show that the plane is bounded by the correct values; It should look like a flat plane sitting at $z=\frac{1}{4}$, and be bounded by the values $-1 \leq x,y \leq 1$.
