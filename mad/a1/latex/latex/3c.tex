Looking at the plot seen below there is a noticeably larger variance in the $\hat{\theta}_{stupid}$ estimator, with more extreme values than in the sample mean. This observation is also proven by taking the average of the absolute value of the variances, which gives the following result:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stupid estimate average variance: 0.4561300748973738
\item Sample mean average variance: 0.36271949341394294
\end{itemize}
