There is quite a noticeable bias in the variance, as can be seen on the graph above. It tends to be lower than the true variance. This is likely due to the fact that we have used the normal distribution, in which extreme values are extremely uncommon. In the graphs given above, and seen in the Jupyter Notebook, we have constructed an adjusted variance estimator using the average \#FINISH THIS
