To compute the likelihood we have to find the joint pdf: $f_\theta^{joint}(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)$. For this specific distribution, the joint pdf can be described as thus:
$$
\theta_1 = \prod_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{(4+1)\cdot(3+1)} = \prod_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{160000}
$$
$$
\theta_2 = \prod_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{(5+2)\cdot(6+3)} = \prod_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{63} = \frac{1}{15752961}
$$
