The null hypothesis for this experiment would be that there is no effect on the flowering time. This means that we by default assume that the flowering time is unchanged, and we would have to prove otherwise, beyond reasonable doubt. The reason for this is that it is better to erroneously claim that you have not found a positive result than it is to erroneously claim that you have.
