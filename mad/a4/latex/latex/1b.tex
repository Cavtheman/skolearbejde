To estimate the location where he falls down, we simply have to look at the weights of $w$. This leads us to a function that looks as follows:
$$
f(x) =-0.9788095238095242x^2 + 9.982809523809527x -0.4659999999999926
$$
We make sure the model intersects $(0,0)$ by setting $c = 0$, and solve for $f(x) = 0$ using Wolfram Alpha and get the following value for the landing: 
$$
x = 10.19892970080272
$$
This approach has the unfortunate side effect of giving the model an inherent bias. But the alternative of having some points in the model we know for a fact are wrong seems to be worse.
