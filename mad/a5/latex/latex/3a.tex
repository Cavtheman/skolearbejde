We know that with $p(t|w,X,\sigma^2)$, $t$ is defined as follows, with $\sigma^2 = 10$:
$$
t = Xw + \epsilon
$$
Where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(Xw, \sigma^2I)$. This is a Gaussian random variable with the constant added to the mean. This means our likelihood looks as follows:
$$
p(t|w,X,\sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(Xw,10 \cdot I_N)
$$
We know that our model has zero mean, so we can write the following:
$$
p(t|w,X,\sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(0,10)
$$
