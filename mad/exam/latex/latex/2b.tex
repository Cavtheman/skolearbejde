To perform this statistical test, we have to go through the six steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item A model: \\
The model is given as $X \sim Bin(n,\theta)$, with $n = 20$
\item A hypothesis: \\
A hypothesis is given as well: $H_0: \theta = 0.5, H_1: \theta \neq 0.5$
\item A test statistic and distribution: \\
\item A significance level: \\
The significance level is also given as $\alpha = 0.05$
\item A rejection region: \\
A rejection region is given as: $\mathcal{R}=\{0,...,a\}\cup\{20-a,...,20\}$
\item Compute test statistic: \\
\end{itemize}
