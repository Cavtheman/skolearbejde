The function $h_\sigma$ is what determines how heavily the regression function should weight each point of data. This means that when it is very large, each point in the given data means less to the end outcome. Likewise, when it is small, each point changes the resulting model significantly more. What this means is that the same effects happen for small sigma and large sigma values, respectively. The inverse is then also true for $||\bar{x}-x_n||^2$.
