The sequence defined as thus will break the test, and be defined as convergent, when in reality it is divergent at $x\geq 50$. It will be  considered convergent when $t = 1$, but may pass the test at smaller $t$ values. The first part for $x < 50$ is the convergent series taken from the assignment. The second series is the divergent series $\sum_{n=50}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$. I have found this series here: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)}
$$
f(x) =
\Bigg\{
\begin{array}{rrr}
\frac{1}{n} & when & x \leq 50\\
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} & when & x > 50	\\
\end{array}
$$
