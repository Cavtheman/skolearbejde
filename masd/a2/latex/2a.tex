\subsubsection{}
This expression \textbf{will not} give $\frac{df}{dt}$ at time $t$, because $\Delta t$ does not approach 0.

This expresssion \textbf{will} give $\frac{df}{dt}$ at time $t$. Since $h$ is a constant, it does not matter whether we multiply anything to it, as long as we do the same to all instances of $h$
\subsubsection{}
This expresssion \textbf{will} give $\frac{df}{dt}$ at time $t$. Following the same logic as the previous expression, this expression is simply the same as multiplying $h$ by a negative number. As told in the lectures, the formula should work for both positive and negative values of $h$. In this case, $h$ is simply replaced by another name, $\Delta t$.
