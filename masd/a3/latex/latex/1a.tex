To find all the extremum points of the function we have to look at where $f'(x) = 0$. To find whether the points are local maxima or minima, we have to look at $f''(x)$.

$$f(x) = 2x^2+(x-4)^3$$
$$f'(x) = 4x+3(x-4)^2$$
First we try to find if, and where $f'(x)$ intersects the x-axis.

$$4x+3(x-4)^2 = 0$$
$$d = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16-12}}{6} = \frac{-4 \pm 2}{6}$$
$$d_1 = \frac{-1}{3}, d_2= -1$$
Since both $d_1$ and $d_2$ are negative, there exist no intersections between $f(x)$ and the x-axis. This means that we cannot draw a conclusion whether it is a maximum or minimum.
