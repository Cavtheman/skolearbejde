For this, we start by rewriting the orthonormal basis $b_1, b_2$ to a matrix $B$:
$$
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2}\\
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}  & \frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
We can then calculate the product of the different vectors with this matrix and find their coordinates in the basis $B$. I will label the three vectors given as $a=(0,0),b=(1,0),c=(2,3)$ respectively.
$$
Ba = (0,0)_B
$$
$$
Bb = (\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2}+0, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+0)_B = (\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})_B
$$
$$
Bc = (2\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2}+3\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2})_B = (-5\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2})_B
$$
