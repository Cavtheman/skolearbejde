To determine whether a point is on the "green" or "blue" side of the subspace, we have to make observation that the normal vector is always perpendicular to the subspace. This means that if we calculate the dot product of the vector and any point, the result will be positive if it is on one side of the subspace, and negative on the other. Thus, we have an easy way to determine which side it is on.
