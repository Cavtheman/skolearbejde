This exercise has been completed in the attached Jupyter Notebook.\\
The end result of my code seems to have more noise than the guideline pictures. It seems that this noise comes from the algorithm used in exercise 4b, from which the output picture seems to be brighter than the guideline, which may lead to more noise being picked up by the later parts. It is very likely from this exercise that the errors in later exercises appear.
