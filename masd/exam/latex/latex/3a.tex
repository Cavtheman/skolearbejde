The expression \textit{pmf} stands for the "probability mass function".\\
The \textit{pmf} of $X \sim \textit{Poiss}(\lambda)$ can be written as follows, as per table 1.1 in the "MASD\_essentials\_ch1-updated.pdf" on Absalon:
$$
p(x)=e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^x}{x!}
$$
This expression is used to calculate the probability of $x$ events happening, when there is an average of $\lambda$ events happening.
