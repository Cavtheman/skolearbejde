The decimal number $\frac{4}{5}$ cannot be displayed in binary with a finite amount of numbers. It looks as follows:
\begin{align*}
\frac{4}{5} &= 0.8_{10}\\
0.8 * 2 &= 1.6, \text{Integral part} = 1 \\
0.6 * 2 &= 1.2, \text{Integral part} = 1 \\
0.2 * 2 &= 0.4, \text{Integral part} = 0 \\
0.4 * 2 &= 0.8, \text{Integral part} = 0 \\
0.8 * 2 &= 1.6, \text{Integral part} = 1
\end{align*}
We can see that it begins repeating here, so the binary representation will look as follows:
$$
0.\overline{1100}
$$
Meaning that the sequence "1100" repeats forever.
