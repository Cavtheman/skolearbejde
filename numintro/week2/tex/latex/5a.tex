To show this approximation, we first use a truncated Taylor series for $cos(x)$. We can do this because $x \rightarrow 0$:
$$
cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}
$$
Then we can say:
$$
1 \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}
$$
This means that our error is:
$$
\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}
$$
We can then solve:
$$
\frac{1}{2} * 10^{-8} = \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}
$$
The solution for this approximates to $x \approx 0.0001$. This means that for the approximation $cos(x) \approx 1$, to be accurate, $x$ would have to be less than or equal to roughly $0.0001$.
