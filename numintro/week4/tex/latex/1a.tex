To formulate this as a root finding problem, we first have to find the formula for $S$, so we can rewrite:
$$
S = \pi r l + \pi r^2
$$
Where $l$ is the slant height of the cone.
$$
l = \sqrt{r^2+h^2}
$$
We rewrite this into one expression, and insert the known values:
\begin{align*}
  1200 &= \pi r \sqrt{r^2+400} + \pi r^2 \\
  0 &= \pi r \sqrt{r^2+400} + \pi r^2 - 1200
\end{align*}
Now the expression can be solved as a root finding problem.
