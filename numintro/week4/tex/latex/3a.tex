Using the secant algorithm implemented in Q0020.py, with starting values of $x_0 = 10$ and $x_1 = 12$, we find that the solution to the problem is approximately $11.196$ with precision $10^{-9}$ after 4 iterations, not including $x_0$ and $x_1$.\\
This has been done by implementing the expression we found in exercise 1 as a function just like the "$f$" function in the file.
