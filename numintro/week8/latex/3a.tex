The results for the integral error were definitely not expected. I assumed that the accuracy would go up as $n$ went up. However, I would guess that this is due to the fact that the approximating function approaches the real function quite well in the middle of the given interval, as $n$ increases, but diverges significantly at the edges. As can be seen in the graphs above, this error increases exponentially after roughly $n = 50$.

The results for the derivative in $t=0$ were expected, as that is the true value. The value for $t=1$ is slightly off the actual result of $-1/e$ or roughly $-0.36787$. This is to be expected though, as it does not have perfect accuracy.
